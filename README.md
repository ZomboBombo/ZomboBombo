### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sergey Novikov. I am Junior Frontend Developer.

Since the end of 2018, I have been actively studying front-end technologies, developing websites in HTML & CSS, programming a little in JS.

### Facts about me:
* ðŸŒ± I love marking up web-pages semantically and valid, and I try to make interfaces as convenient and accessible as possible.
* ðŸ’¬ I write the code carefully and consistently, leave clear explanatory comments.
* âš¡ In my free time I do sports, fond of video games, read fiction and technical literature, and sometimes even watch TV-series :)
